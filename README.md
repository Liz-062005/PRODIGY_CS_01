July 5-Repository Setup
Create main repo: ProGD-Internship-July2025, README.md and researched the Caesar Cipher algorithm â€” understood how shifting works, how it handles alphabets, and how encryption and decryption are done.

 July 6-Created a new Google Colab notebook. Wrote the encrypt() function to shift characters in the input text based on a user-defined key.
 
July 7:Implemented the decrypt() function in the Colab notebook and tested both functions with sample inputs.

July 8:Added user input functionality in the notebook so that users can enter a message and shift value. Ran multiple test cases.
  
July 9:Took a screenshot of the final output. Downloaded the .ipynb file and uploaded it to GitHub under Task-01_Caesar-Cipher/.
